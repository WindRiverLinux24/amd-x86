3.1.4 Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~

1) The serial port console can be used on board is ttyS4 or ttyS5.

  AMDI0020:00: ttyS4 at MMIO 0xfedc9000 (irq = 3, base_baud = 3000000) is a 16550A
  AMDI0020:01: ttyS5 at MMIO 0xfedca000 (irq = 4, base_baud = 3000000) is a 16550A

2) The AMD FirePro W2100 GPU card can be supported by radeon driver or by amdgpu driver.
The default driver is radeon. To override it, use "radeon.si_support=0 amdgpu.si_support=1"
in kernel boot cmdline.

3.1.5 Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) You may see the following unexpected call trace.

  Call Trace:
   <TASK>
   ttm_bo_release+0x218/0x350 [ttm]
   ttm_bo_put+0x34/0x50 [ttm]

   syscall_exit_to_user_mode+0x21/0x50
   do_syscall_64+0x50/0x90
   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x61/0xcb

It is related to AMD FirePro W2100 GPU card and Linux radeon driver. The call trace is
shown when system/screen is back from sleep or display resolution is changed. No affected
functionality is observed. This issue is under investigation.

2) "nproc --all" may show incorrect number of CPU on the board.

According to ACPI MADT of the board, the total supported CPU number is 128. The supported
CPU number in Linux is limited to 64, due to CONFIG_NR_CPUS=64 in kernel config.
That's why you can see "smpboot: 128 Processors exceeds NR_CPUS limit of 64" in kernel boot log.
And the number reported by /sys/devices/system/cpu/possible is 64, due to the same reason.

In LTS23, "nproc --all" gets the CPU number from "/sys/devices/system/cpu/possible".
This number may not be the actual number of CPU installed on the board. It is just the number
reported by ACPI MDAT table.

So "nproc --all" and "nproc" may show different number due to buggy BIOS/firmware.
If you want to avoid this issue, you can use "nr_cpus=n" in kernel boot parameters to limit
the supported CPU number in kernel. For example, if you have 16 CPUs installed on board, you can
set nr_cpus=16, then "nproc --all" and "nproc" will both return 16.

3) Speculative Return Stack Overflow (SRSO)
You may see the following messages from kernel boot log.

  Speculative Return Stack Overflow: IBPB-extending microcode not applied!
  Speculative Return Stack Overflow: Mitigation: safe RET, no microcode

It means the mitigation for SRSO is software-only. It only addresses User->Kernel and Guest->Host
transitions protection. If you need microcode mitigation, please contact you CPU/BIOS vendor.
